Hello! This is meicheng, VoiceCheck's primary developer until my sister wakes up.

You know the age-old dilemma. Roommates can be loud and lack self-awareness.
You don't want to constantly tap their shoulder and ask them to keep it down.
They try to keep it down, but honestly just don't know how they got so loud.

VoiceCheck is an application that will:
1) notify you if your voice goes over a certain sound level.
2) notify you if you're talking too much trash.

GLHF!
